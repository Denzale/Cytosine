## Demo


## Built With

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Express, our web framework
* [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) - Morgan, an improved logging library that works nicely with Express. Now, all requests to our server get logged out in the console. 
* [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) - Sequelize, our ORM
* [express-jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-jwt) - A small library that checks JWTs for us. This is what passport did for us last time!
* [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) - Small library for generating JWTs. Used instead of passport for visibility and so we don't have a magic library chilling there.
